Example: calculation of HOMO LUMO gap of benzene on MoS2 (3x3 supercell), using the code package in /XAF-GW/MxM_supercell/

Instructions for each folder (run the code in the following order):
QE-bz for mono layer of benzene molecule in supercell
QE-MoS2 for unit cell MoS2
QE for the full system
(The pseudopotentials for the above QuantumESPRESSO calculations are not included. 
to compare with the results in 08-addchi one can download the pseudopotentials on :
http://www.quantum-simulation.org/potentials/sg15_oncv/
Mo_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf     14-electron
S_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf       6-electron
C_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf       4-electron
H_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf       1-electron)
06-bz: calculate chi matrix for bz layer (supercell)
06-MoS2: calculate chi matrix for MoS2 (unit cell). Accuracy of the cell parameters should be higher than 9 digits to be consistent
         with the supercell cell parameters.
expandchi: expand the chi matrix of MoS2 from unit cell to 3 x 3 supercell
addchi: add the chi matrix of bz and MoS2 together in supercell 
07-addchi: get the epsilon matrix using the added chi matrix
08-fullsigma: use full system wavefunction for WFN_inner to calculate bz HOMO LUMO gap with addchi epsilon matrix. (The corresponding
HOMO LUMO band index in full system can be obtained by wfn_dotproduct.x from BerkeleyGW package. Using the pseudopotential in the
above link, bz molecule has to two degenerate HOMO (bands index 14 15) and two degenerate LUMO (bands index 16 17). The maximium 
overlap of full system wavefunction with the molecular HOMO LUMO is defined to be the HOMO LUMO level of the full system.)
