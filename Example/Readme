Example benzene on MoS2 (3x3 supercell)
instructrions for each folder (run the code in the following order):
QE-bz for mono layer of benzene molecule in supercell
QE-MoS2 for unit cell MoS2
QE for the full system
06-bz: calculate chi matrix for bz layer (supercell)
06-MoS2: calculate chi matrix for MoS2 (unit cell)
expandchi: expand the chi matrix of MoS2 from unit cell to 3 x 3 supercell
addchi: add the chi matrix of bz and MoS2 together in supercell 
07-addchi: get the epsilon matrix using the added chi matrix
08-addchi: use full system wavefunction for WFN_inner to calculate bz HOMO LUMO gap with addchi epsilon matrix.
