Example: calculation of HOMO LUMO gap of benzene on MoS2 (3x3 supercell)
Instructions for each folder (run the code in the following order):
QE-bz for mono layer of benzene molecule in supercell
QE-MoS2 for unit cell MoS2
QE for the full system
(The pseudopotentials for the above QuantumESPRESSO calculations are not included. 
to compare with the results in 08-addchi one can download the pseudopotentials on :
http://www.quantum-simulation.org/potentials/sg15_oncv/
Mo_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf
S_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf
C_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf
H_ONCV_PBE-1.0.upf)
06-bz: calculate chi matrix for bz layer (supercell)
06-MoS2: calculate chi matrix for MoS2 (unit cell)
expandchi: expand the chi matrix of MoS2 from unit cell to 3 x 3 supercell
addchi: add the chi matrix of bz and MoS2 together in supercell 
07-addchi: get the epsilon matrix using the added chi matrix
08-addchi: use full system wavefunction for WFN_inner to calculate bz HOMO LUMO gap with addchi epsilon matrix. (The corresponding
HOMO LUMO band index in full system can be obtained by wfn_dotproduct.x from BerkeleyGW package.)
